# Web Crawler Challenge

- All functional code is in the `index.js` file.

- To run tests, clone or download repository and in the terminal run `node index.js`

  - When running each `internet` TEST, need to copy/paste the JSON data into the `data` variable.

- It's currently an incomplete test receiving inaccurate results. I had trouble with knowing how to follow the links, as strings, from `address` to `links`. The test results only show whether or not there are duplicates present in the lists.

- I focus on writing code that could be easily understood by the next developer. Starting out writing with pseudocode to help understand the problem of what I need to accomplish.
